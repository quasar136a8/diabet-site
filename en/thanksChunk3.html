   <blockquote>Good day! As always, two words won't do 😅 This is the third aid from the fund and every time we think that there is much more! But it turns out that there is room and this is not just a pleasant surprise! In general, it is hard to believe that someone helps and REALLY helps not only with words and promises! Unfortunately, these vital things are not affordable for everyone... Therefore, words simply cannot express our gratitude to the entire foundation and personally to Sergey, Eduard and Mrs. Schmidt-Schmiedebach! For such incredible support🧡</blockquote>
