   <blockquote>Today, we again received help from our dear "Fund for assistance and rehabilitation of diabetes patients." We express our gratitude to Mr. Eduard for your kind and sincere heart, your work is invaluable, it helps people maintain a normal life, we thank you and Mr. Serhiy and everyone to the employees of the foundation, for sending our daughter the sensors, sugar substitutes and vitamins we need in a timely manner, because without them a normal life with diabetes in small children is impossible. Many thanks to the Malva Children's Association of Ukraine, many thanks to Friends from Italy, and to the pharmaceutical company for the vitamins. Words of gratitude cannot even be chosen. You make our children happier. Mr. Eduard, thank you for your compassionate soul. 🙏🙏🧡💙</blockquote>
