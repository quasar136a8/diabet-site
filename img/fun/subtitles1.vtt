00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:7.000
Our history of sugar monitoring.

2
00:00:8.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We are 1.5 years old, we measure sugar approximately 8 times a day.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Therefore, our tiny fingers are very pricked (((

4
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It is not always possible to persuade a baby to measure sugar with a glucometer, so we "catch" and measure, no matter how inconvenient it may be.

5
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We received a sensor "Libra 1" and a sweet gift from the fund.

6
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We install the sensor without a single cry.

7
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Fast and painless.

8
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Son is happy)

9
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
They measured sugar with a phone when the child was playing.

10
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Didn't even notice)

11
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The sensor is our salvation! It makes our life much easier! Parents are calm and children are happy)

12
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
We are infinitely grateful to the foundation and to all those who support our vital help.
