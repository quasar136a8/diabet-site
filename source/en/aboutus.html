                Our mission
            </h2>
            <p class="our-mission__text">
                The mission of the Foundation is to help children, the elderly and everyone who needs support in the fight against diabetes. We protect social rights, improve living conditions and medical care, organize events to draw public attention to the problems of diabetes patients, advise on prevention and treatment, provide vital devices and medicines. Taking into account the Russian aggression, today our Foundation has taken as a basis to do everything possible to support the military, who, without sparing their lives, defend our country on the front line. We are making every effort to help the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as IDPs from the "hot" spots.
